-- ============================================================================
-- ACTUAL SCHEMA USED
-- ============================================================================
-- Based on code analysis:
--
-- wedding_members table has these columns:
--   - wedding_id (uuid, foreign key to wedding_profiles.id)
--   - user_id (uuid, foreign key to auth.users.id)
--   - role (text: 'owner', 'member', etc.)
--
-- NO status column exists!
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('wedding_profiles', 'wedding_members')
ORDER BY tablename;
-- Expected: rowsecurity = true for both

-- Count policies
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('wedding_profiles', 'wedding_members')
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
-- Expected: wedding_profiles = 4, wedding_members = 5

-- List all policies
SELECT
  tablename,
  policyname,
  cmd as operation
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('wedding_profiles', 'wedding_members')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- ============================================================================
-- TESTING (EXAMPLES - DO NOT RUN AUTOMATICALLY)
-- ============================================================================
-- These are example queries to run manually after deployment.
-- They are commented out to prevent errors during migration.
-- ============================================================================

/*
-- Test 1: View your weddings (should work)

-- Test 2: View wedding members (should work)

-- Test 3: As owner, update wedding (should work)
